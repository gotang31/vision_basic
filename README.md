# Goal of this repository
- By using a training tool, understand a traning loop of vision model like DETR and Resnet50.
- By upload my code to this repository, share my knowledge and mistakes for better ability.
- By extending to front-end and back-end, try the full stack for vision AI service.

# Origin of code
- During last half year, I studied AI and proceeded with a project about vision AI at "지능정보 SW아카데미" in Korea University.
- In the case of vision AI code, mostly I made that code. But code of front or back-end is largely affected by my teammate.
- Thanks to the teammate.
